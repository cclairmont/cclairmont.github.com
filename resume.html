<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<dt>Summer Research Student: Yale University School of Medicine</dt>
<dd>Summer 2011 &amp 2012 in the lab of Dr. Joann Sweasy<dd/>
<br/>
<dd>Worked on several projects related to base excision repair of damaged
    DNA in mammalian cells, including charactarization of mice with a germ 
    line mutation of DNA polymerase beta.  Gained extensive experience
    with flourescence microscopy, PCR and gel electrophoresis.  Gained some
    experience with protein purification, western blotting, mammalian
    tissue culture and bacterial cloning.

<dd>Click <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493258">here</a> to
    see the paper we published about the Y265C germline mutation in mice </dd>
<br/>
<dt>Research Student: Tufts University</dt>
<dd>Fall 2012 - Present in the lab of Dr. Mitch McVey</dd><br/>
<dd>Working on creating and charactarizing Rev1 mutations in the model
    organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Rev1 is a translesion polymerase,
    although recent work has shown it to play an important non-catalytic
    role in homologous recombination repair of double strand DNA breaks
    which we are investigating further. </dd>
