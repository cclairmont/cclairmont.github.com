<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Connor Clairmont, I'm currently a Junior studying <br/>
   biochemistry and computer science at Tufts University.  My main <br/>
   area of interest is molecular biological and biomedical research. <br/>
   More specifically, my current area of interest is DNA damage and <br/>
   repair and its implications for diseases such as cancer, although I <br/>
   am interested in branching out and learning new fields.  I am also <br/>
   interested in how computational techniques can be used to further <br/>
   research in biological sciences. </p>
