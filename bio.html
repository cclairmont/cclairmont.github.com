<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Connor Clairmont, I'm currently a Junior studying
   biochemistry and computer science at Tufts University.  My main
   area of interest is molecular biological and biomedical research.
   More specifically, my current area of interest is DNA damage and
   repair and its implications for diseases such as cancer, although I
   am interested in branching out and learning new fields.  I am also
   interested in how computational techniques can be used to further
   research in biological sciences. </p>
