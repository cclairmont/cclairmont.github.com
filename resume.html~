<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<dt>Summer Research Student: Yale University School of Medicine</dt>
<dd>Summer 2011 &amp 2012 in the lab of Dr. Joann Sweasy<dd/>
<br/>
<dd>Worked on several projects related to base excision repair of damaged <br/>
    DNA in mammalian cells, including charactarization of mice with a germ <br/>
    line mutation of DNA polymerase beta.  Gained extensive experience <br/>
    with flourescence microscopy, PCR and gel electrophoresis.  Gained some<br/>
    experience with protein purification, western blotting, mammalian <br/>
    tissue culture and bacterial cloning. <br/>
</dd><br/>
<dd>Click <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493258">here</a> to
    see the paper we published about the Y265C germline mutation in mice </dd>
<br/>
<dt>Research Student: Tufts University</dt>
<dd>Fall 2012 - Present in the lab of Dr. Mitch McVey</dd><br/>
<dd>Working on creating and charactarizing Rev1 mutations in the model <br/>
    organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Rev1 is a translesion polymerase, <br/>
    although recent work has shown it to play an important non-catalytic <br/>
    role in homologous recombination repair of double strand DNA breaks <br/>
    which we are investigating further. </dd>
<br/>


<h2>Skills</h2>
<dt>Extensive experience with standard molecular biology techniques</dt>
<dd>Including: PCR, gel electrophoresis, bacterial cloning (traditional <br/>
    cloning, TOPO cloning, recombineering, and Gibson assembly) </dd><br/>
<dt>Some experience with biochemical techniques</dt>
<dd>Including: Protein purification and western blotting</dd><br/>
<dt>Some experience with mammalian tissue culture</dt><br/>
<dt>Some expeience using Drosophila melanogaster a model organism</dt>
<dd>Including: Setting up crosses, identifying common phenotypic markers, <br/>
    Imprecise P-element excisions, Gene targeting </dd><br/>
<dt>Computer skills</dt>
<dd>Proficiency in C and C++, Proficiency with the Microsoft Office Suite <br/>
    Proficiency with Unix-like systems </dd><br/>
